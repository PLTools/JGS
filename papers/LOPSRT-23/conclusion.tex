\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented here the first iteration of \textsc{Java} generics type solver implementation using relational verifier-to-solver
conversion technique. While the solver does not demonstrate desirable performance yet this work nevertheless showcases all
major steps, properties, and caveats of the approach we advocate. We consider the development and application of problem-specific
optimizations of the solver as the main direction for future research. Our prior experience shows that such optimizations
can boost the performance of the solver to the level neccessary to be used as a component in a symbolic execution engine for verification
and testing of real-world \textsc{Java} applications.
